Immortality is not some fairytale and alreaduy exists in nature. Some animals plants and simpler organisms (show) negligible senescence
his means that in a perfect enviroment without hazards they could potentially live forever.

NEGLIGIBLE SENESCENCE
For the first example we will take a look at the lobster. Lobsters dont age and in fact dont lose power and speed with age. And 
guess what lobsters have high production of telomerase, the enzyme that repairs DNA sequences and allows for infinite cell 
division. But while lobster for some reason have never ending telomerase they are not immortal even in a perfect enviroment as
they will propably die from exhaustion when they shed their cell and old lobsters stop creating new shells meaning that when the old is damaged 
and infected they wont make it. Well this is just part of (mortality) lobsters werent supposed to live forever. Even humans have
such limitations its part of trying to reeingineer life.


Perfect examples
Its time for a perfect example. simple
organism called hydra that doesnt exceed 10mm length creates telomerase without a stop. But since the organism is so simple 
it doesnt meet its end from other problems, like the lobster's inability to create a shell or like human neuron cells not being
replaceable.

Immortality in nature 


If we see the
lobster as a machine then by 

tortoises, some tortoises show negligible senescence
